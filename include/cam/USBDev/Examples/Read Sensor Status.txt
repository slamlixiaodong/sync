1. Run sirdev directly and execute command "pr";
2. You will see a list of PLL registers read as "PLL Status Word X is XXXXXXXX.";
3. For each PLL status word it represents a specific sensor.

Sensor Map
0	TOF
1	RGB
3	Iris1
4	Iris2

Data Bits
31	DCM locked bit. Note that when the clock input is lost, this bit will also be high.
30	DCM phase shift completed. 
29	Align failed
28	DCM phase shift overflow. This bit is reserved.
27:24	DCM type. 0002: Advanced DCM controller
23:16	IODelay tap count.
15:0	Read-out of phase shift current value (for phase alignment control)

Example data
PLL Status Word 0 is 225E01D9	Bit [29] is 1, means the TOF sensor fails.
PLL Status Word 3 is 827C0235	Bit [29] is 0, means the Iris1 sensor is OK.
